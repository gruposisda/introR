# filter ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Find all flights that:
# 
# Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
# Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
# Were operated by United, American, or Delta
# Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
# Arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late
# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
# Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
#
#   
#How many flights have a missing dep_time?



# arrange -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.
# 
# Sort flights to find the fastest flights.
# 
# Which flights travelled the longest? Which travelled the shortest?


# select ------------------------------------------------------------------

#Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.
#What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call?



# mutate -----------------------------------------------------------------

#create a new column ("total_delay") by summing arr_delay and dep_delay
#create a new column ("speed", in miles/hour) using air_time (minutes) and distance (miles)


# group_by and summarise ------------------------------------------------
  

# gráfico chique ----------------------------------------------------------
